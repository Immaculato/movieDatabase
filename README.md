# movieDatabase


- This web application is designed to allow a superuser add, change, and delete a movie database.
- Users will first register and then are able to filter the database with a faceted search.


### Prerequisites

```
* Python version 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. Python 3+ is recommended.
* Python virtual environment
* Django 1.8+
```

### Installing

* If you’re on Linux or Mac OS X, you probably have Python already installed. Type python at a command prompt (or in Applications/Utilities/Terminal, in OS X).
* Assuming Python is not installed in your system, we first need to get the installer. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and click the big yellow button that says “Download Python 3.x.x”
```
* python -m pip install -U pip 
```
Install virtual environment
```
* pip install virtualenv 
* virtualenv env_mysite 
* env_mysite\scripts\activate 
```
Finally, install Django.
```
* pip install django==1.8.13 
```
